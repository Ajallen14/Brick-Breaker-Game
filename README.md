# [**Tic Tac Toe**](https://github.com/Ajallen14/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game/blob/master/TicTacToe.java)

* **initializeBoard()** : fills the board with empty spaces.

* **printBoard()** :  displays the current state of the board in a formatted manner.

* **playerMove()** :  prompts the current player for their move (row and column indices). It validates the input to ensure the move is within bounds and the chosen cell is empty.

* **isWinner()** :  checks for winning combinations across rows, columns, and diagonals.

* **isBoardFull()** :   checks if there are any empty spaces left on the board.

* **switchPlayer()** : alternates the current player between 'X' and 'O'.
